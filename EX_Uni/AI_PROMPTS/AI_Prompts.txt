are the outputs correct?


Answer:

Let's analyze each part of the output.

‚úÖ BFS & DFS Traversal:
BFS Traversal: 0 4 3 2 1

DFS Traversal: 0 4 3 2 1

The traversal orders can be valid depending on how the graph is constructed and the order in which edges are traversed. For both BFS and DFS to produce the same order, the graph likely has a tree-like structure or special connection pattern.
This is possible but unusual. Double-check your traversal implementation to make sure you are actually using BFS and DFS correctly.

Vertex 0 : -> (3, weight: 3) -> (2, weight: 4) -> (4, weight: 6)

3+4+6+2=15

The edges are selected in ascending order of weight without forming cycles.

Appears to be correct if this is a connected, undirected graph.

‚úÖ MST using Prim's Algorithm:

Vertex 0 : -> (3, weight: 3) -> (1, weight: 1)
Vertex 1 : -> (4, weight: 2) -> (2, weight: 3) -> (0, weight: 1)

Vertex 3 : -> (0, weight: 3)
Vertex 4 : -> (1, weight: 2)

3+1+2+3=9

This weight does not match the Kruskal‚Äôs MST (15).

This suggests that either Kruskal's MST is wrong, or Prim‚Äôs algorithm used a different approach.

‚ùì Why the Difference in MSTs (Kruskal vs Prim):
Kruskal‚Äôs algorithm seems to have chosen a path with higher weight (6).

Prim‚Äôs algorithm appears to have selected a cheaper path (2, 3, 1, 3).

‚úÖ Shortest Path Tree using Dijkstra's Algorithm:
yaml
Copy
Edit
Vertex 0 : -> (3, weight: 3) -> (2, weight: 4) -> (1, weight: 1)
Vertex 1 : -> (4, weight: 3) -> (0, weight: 1)
Vertex 2 : -> (0, weight: 4)
Vertex 3 : -> (0, weight: 3)
Vertex 4 : -> (1, weight: 3)
This appears to be correct if the graph is weighted and connected.

Dijkstra's algorithm finds the shortest path from the starting vertex (0) to all others.

üîç Summary of Issues:
The MSTs from Kruskal and Prim are not the same.

It appears that Kruskal‚Äôs implementation might be incorrect (choosing heavier edges).

Prompt:
can you give me an example of how to create a test file in order to use DOCTEST with my graph?

Answer:
#define DOCTEST_CONFIG_IMPLEMENT_WITH_MAIN
#include "doctest.h"

#include "../graph/Graph.h"
#include "../graph/Algorithms.h"

using namespace graph;

TEST_CASE("Test Kruskal's MST") {
    Graph g(5);  // 5 vertices
    g.addEdge(0, 1, 1);
    g.addEdge(0, 3, 3);
    g.addEdge(1, 4, 2);
    g.addEdge(1, 2, 3);

    auto mst = Algorithms::kruskalMST(g);

    CHECK(mst.size() == 4);  // MST should have V - 1 edges

    int total = 0;
    for (auto e : mst) total += e.weight;

    CHECK(total == 9);  // Expected MST weight
}

how can i see where was the memory leak?

Answer:
To see where exactly the memory leak occurred, you need to run Valgrind with more detailed logging. To do this, use the --leak-check=full option along with --show-leak-kinds=all.

üìå Command to Run
bash
Copy
Edit
valgrind --leak-check=full --show-leak-kinds=all ./testG
üìå What This Does
--leak-check=full ‚Äî Provides detailed information about memory leaks.

--show-leak-kinds=all ‚Äî Shows all types of leaks (definitely lost, indirectly lost, possibly lost, still reachable).

üìå How to Read the Output
It will show exactly where the memory was allocated and not properly freed.

You will see a stack trace pointing to the line in your code responsible for the leak.

üìå Tip
If you want to narrow down the search, try adding:

bash
Copy
Edit
--track-origins=yes
This helps in tracing uninitialized memory reads, which could also be helpful if the leak is caused by improper use of dynamically allocated memory.

Would you like me to help you analyze the output once you run this? üòä
